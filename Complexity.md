Your analysis is solid, but letâ€™s refine it into a clearer breakdown to ensure every part aligns with the **overall time complexity** of the `process_deliveries` method:

---

### **Key Operations**
Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of each component:

#### 1. **Extracting Data from CSV Files**
- **Operation**: Reading CSV data and populating initial structures.
- **Complexity**: \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the total number of packages in the CSV file.

---

#### 2. **HashMap Operations**
- **Operation**: Storing packages in a `HashMap`, retrieving them by `address_index`, and updating their status during delivery.
- **Complexity**: \( O(1) \) average for each operation (e.g., `get`, `add`, `merge_add`, `delete`).

---

#### 3. **Nearest Neighbor Algorithm**
- **Operation**: Finding the shortest route for the current tripâ€™s packages.
- **Complexity**: \( O(m^2) \), where \( m \) is the number of stops (addresses) in the current trip. This is due to comparing all pairs of stops to find the nearest unvisited node.

- **For all trips**: If there are \( \lceil n / c \rceil \) trips, the complexity becomes \( O((n/c) \cdot m^2) \).

---

#### 4. **Undelivered Package Loop**
- **Operation**: Iterating through undelivered packages to assign up to \( c \) packages to the truck.
- **Complexity per trip**: \( O(c) \), as it processes only up to the truckâ€™s capacity.

- **For all trips**: \( O(n) \), since the loop runs \( \lceil n / c \rceil \) times.

---

#### 5. **Route Execution**
**Loop Through the Route**:
- **Operation**: For each stop in the route, the truck delivers packages and updates relevant information.
- **Complexity per trip**: \( O(m) \), where \( m \) is the number of stops for the current trip.

- **For all trips**: \( O(n) \), since \( \sum m = n \) across all trips.

**Distance Calculations Using Distance Matrix**:
- **Operation**: Accessing the adjacency matrix to retrieve distances.
- **Complexity**: \( O(1) \) for each lookup.

**Update Delivery Time**:
- **Operation**: Marking a package as delivered and updating its delivery time.
- **Complexity**: \( O(1) \) per package.

---

### **Total Time Complexity**

#### Per Trip:
\[
O(m^2 + c + m)
\]
- \( O(m^2) \): Nearest neighbor optimization.
- \( O(c) \): Loading up to \( c \) packages.
- \( O(m) \): Delivering \( m \) packages.

#### For All Trips:
\[
\text{Number of trips} = \lceil n / c \rceil
\]

Multiply by the complexity per trip:
\[
O((n/c) \cdot (m^2 + c + m))
\]

---

### **Simplified Complexity**
- \( m \leq c \), so \( O(m) \) and \( O(c) \) are comparable.
- Drop \( O(c) \) since itâ€™s dominated by \( O(m^2) \).

Final complexity:
\[
O(n \cdot m^2) \quad \text{or equivalently} \quad O(n \cdot c^2)
\]

Where:
- \( n \): Total packages.
- \( c \): Truck capacity.

---

### **Key Observations**
- The **dominant factor** is \( O(n \cdot c^2) \), primarily from the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm.
- **HashMap operations and adjacency matrix lookups** are negligible compared to route optimization and delivery loops.
