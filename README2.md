A.  Identify a named self-adjusting algorithm (e.g., nearest neighbor algorithm, greedy algorithm) that could be used to create your program to deliver the packages.


B.  Identify a self-adjusting data structure, such as a hash table, that could be used with the algorithm identified in part A to store the package data.

1.  Explain how your data structure accounts for the relationship between the data components you are storing.


C.  Write an overview of your program in which you do the following:

1.  Explain the algorithm’s logic using pseudocode.


Note: You may refer to the attached “Sample Core Algorithm Overview” to complete part C1.


2.  Describe the programming environment you will use to create the Python application, including both the software and hardware you will use.

3.  Evaluate the space-time complexity of each major segment of the program and the entire program using big-O notation.

4.  Explain the capability of your solution to scale and adapt to a growing number of packages.

5.  Discuss why the software design would be efficient and easy to maintain.

6.  Describe both the strengths and weaknesses of the self-adjusting data structure (e.g., the hash table).

7.  Justify the choice of a key for efficient delivery management from the following components:

•   delivery address

•   delivery deadline

•   delivery city

•   delivery zip code

•   package ID

•   package weight

•   delivery status (i.e., at the hub, en route, or delivered), including the delivery time


D.  Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.


E.  Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.
